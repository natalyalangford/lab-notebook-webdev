## Reflection Document

### HTML

In Lab 1, I completed four HTML exercises: lists, images, tables, and forms. Through these exercises, I learned how to use different types of HTML tags to structure content on a webpage. 

- For lists, I practiced using `<ul>`, `<ol>`, and `<li>` tags to organize bullet and numbered lists. 
- For images, I learned how to include images using the `<img>` tag and how to use the `alt` attribute for accessibility. 
- For the table exercise, I used `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, and `<td>` to create structured data layouts. 
- For the form exercise, I used `<form>`, `<label>`, `<input>`, `<select>`, and `<textarea>` to collect user input. 
  
These exercises reinforced the importance of semantic HTML and how different elements work together to build web content.


### Accessibility

In these HTML exercises, I paid attention to accessibility by using semantic tags and properly associating labels with form inputs. For example, I made sure to use the `alt` attribute for images to provide descriptions for screen readers. I also used the `for` attribute in `<label>` tags and matched it with the corresponding `id` on `<input>` elements to improve form accessibility.
