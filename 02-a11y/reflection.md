## Reflection Document

### HTML

I worked on improving the structure and semantics of a form element. I ensured that each form control had a corresponding <label>, and I used semantic elements like <fieldset> and <legend> to group related radio buttons. I also checked that form fields used appropriate id and for attributes for better accessibility and screen reader support as well as structured the HTML properly with a <header> and consistent indentation.

### Accessibility

This lab helped me understand how accessibility issues can be easily introduced when building forms and how to resolve them using best practices. I used a WAVE and Lighthouse accessibility audit to detect issues such as missing labels or incorrect input associations and then fixed those by ensuring that each input has an explicitly connected label. I also made sure that radio buttons were grouped semantically using <fieldset> and <legend>, which helps users of screen readers understand the relationship between the options.
