## Reflection Document

### HTML

This lab focused on building semantic and structurally organized HTML documents that could be styled using various CSS concepts. 
For example, in 01-selectors.html, I learned to apply different types of CSS selectors such as class, ID, element, to target elements efficiently. Also, in 04-layout.html, I structured content in a way that allowed CSS Grid to display two sections side-by-side. Practicing this helped to understand how the structure of HTML directly affects the layout and behavior of CSS styling.

### Accessibility

Accessibility wasn't the main focus of this lab but accessibility principles were kept in mind by using semantic tags like <header>, <nav>, <section>, and <main>. This ensures that screen readers and other assistive technologies can interpret the page structure accurately.

### CSS

This lab gave me hands-on experience with essential CSS concepts such as:
- Selectors and specificity
- Pseudo-classes
- Layout Systems
- Positioning
- Media Queries
Overall, this lab helped me feel more confident using CSS for both aesthetics and functionality
