## Reflection Document

### HTML

The HTML for this lab was straightforward and mainly served as a container to apply different Flexbox configurations using CSS. 

### Accessibility

Since this lab focused on layout using Flexbox, accessibility considerations were minimal

### CSS

This was the core focus of the lab. I applied a variety of Flexbox properties across different container scenarios, including:
    - flex-direction: row, row-reverse, column-reverse
    - justify-content and align-items combinations
    - Wrapping with flex-wrap: wrap
    - Using order to change item positions
    - Combining flex, min-width, and gap for layout responsiveness

I also used height and padding to fine-tune spacing, and background-color for visual clarity. One main challenge was making sure the layout looked as expected across different containers, especially Flex Container 4, where order and equal spacing were key.
