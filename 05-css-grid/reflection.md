## Reflection Document

### HTML

In this lab, semantic HTML5 elements like <header>, <article>, <aside>, <section>, and <footer> were used. The layout is wrapped inside a <main> element with a class of grid-container which is styled using CSS Grid. Each section was labeled clearly with class names to match the corresponding grid area. This helped create a clean, readable structure and made it easy to assign each region in the grid layout.

### Accessibility

Because semantic HTML elements were used, the layout enhances accessibility. Screen readers and other assistive technologies can better interpret the content's structure and intent.

### CSS

This lab focused on learning CSS Grid and how to assign areas within a grid using grid-template-areas. I styled the layout with grid-template-columns, grid-template-rows, and used media queries to make it responsive for different screen sizes. The use of named grid areas like "header header" and "aside article" made it easy to visualize and manage the layout
