## Reflection Document

### HTML

This lab really focused on JavaScript, but the included HTML was still an essential part—especially in the DOM and fetch exercises

### Accessibility

Buttons and inputs had labels or clear purposes. Although accessibility wasn’t the main focus of the lab, but again it is important to make interactive elements usable for all users, including screen reader support and semantic structure

### CSS

Did not work with a lot of CSS for this lab.
