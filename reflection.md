# Lab Reflections

---

## 01 - HTML

### Completion
I was able to complete the exercises mostly on my own by referencing class notes and reviewing my HTML tags. I didn’t need to use the solutions or videos, but I did look up the correct semantic tags a couple times.

### Helpfulness
The exercises were helpful for getting used to HTML structure. The form exercise was especially useful because it tied a lot of HTML concepts together. The table one helped me the most since I always forget how to span rows or columns.

### Clarity
I think clearer guidance on the `label`-`for` attribute in the form would’ve helped, as I got confused on that part.

### Suggestions
A short exercise on semantic vs. non-semantic tags might help reinforce best practices.

## 02 - Accessibility

### Completion
I completed the accessibility exercise independently using the dev tools' accessibility tree and Lighthouse audit. I referenced class notes for ARIA roles.

### Helpfulness
Super helpful for showing what actually matters to screen readers. I appreciated learning how small changes (like using `label` and headings properly) make a big difference.

### Clarity
A bit more explanation on `aria-*` attributes and when to use them vs. native HTML would’ve been helpful.

### Suggestions
A mini-practice site to audit and fix would be great hands-on reinforcement.

## 03 - CSS

### Completion
I completed the selectors, pseudo-classes, layout, and media queries exercises on my own. I did test changes using the browser inspector and dev tools.

### Helpfulness
The specificity exercise helped solidify what overrides what. Layout and media queries were a little more difficult but important to see in practice.

### Clarity
Media queries were a bit confusing at first—especially how the `min-width` vs `max-width` rules apply.

### Suggestions
An exercise comparing layout with floats vs. flex/grid could help with contraststing modern techniques

---

## 04 - Flexbox

### Completion
I completed the flexbox exercises on my own and played with the flexbox CSS properties to see how things shifted.

### Helpfulness
Very helpful—especially understanding how `justify-content` and `align-items` affect both axes. Seeing it visually helped reinforce the concepts.

### Clarity
I was initially confused by `flex-wrap` and how nested flex containers work. But playing with the styles helped.

### Suggestions
Maybe one guided challenge to recreate a popular UI layout using only flexbox?

---

## 05 - CSS Grid

### Completion
I completed both grid and grid-area exercises without the solution, but I referred to my notes and the MDN docs.

### Helpfulness
Very helpful! I finally understood how grid-template-areas and line-based placement work. It feels more powerful than flexbox in some cases.

### Clarity
It took a while to fully grasp line numbering and why `1 / -1` works. 
Would’ve appreciated more visual guides

### Suggestions
An additional layout challenge with more cells would help reinforce complex grid setups

---

## 06 - Bootstrap

### Completion
I completed all exercises with help from the official Bootstrap documentation. I mostly figured things out through trial and error

### Helpfulness
Bootstrap’s utility classes were helpful and saved a lot of time. The modal and grid exercises gave me insight into how responsive layout is achieved

### Clarity
The grid system was a little confusing at first, especially breakpoints like `col-md-6`

### Suggestions
It would’ve been helpful to include an exercise comparing building the same layout with custom CSS vs. Bootstrap

---

## 07 - JavaScript

### Completion
I completed most of the exercises on my own, but I double-checked MDN for syntax, especially for destructuring and `fetch`

### Helpfulness
The DOM and fetch exercises were the most helpful. They showed me how JS manipulates content in real time and how to interact with APIs
